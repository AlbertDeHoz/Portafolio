# Portfolio
Hi, I am Alberto Alonso and in this repo I want to share with you portfolio's code. I am a  web developer focused in user interface. However, this web page design is not mine. It is strongly inspired by [Matt Farley](https://mattfarley.ca/). I hope, in the future, to give it my personal, by now, that's all there is.

## Dependencies
This web portfolio is developed using basic web technologies, html, css and javascript. Besides, Bulma css Frameworks is used.
